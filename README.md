# Deltaswap Explorer

## Background

_WIP_

It would be more efficient and reliable for...

- an indexer to be populated by an independent party (Fly) listening on the p2p network
- integrators to query a service for signed VAAs instead of round-robining the public phylax endpoints

More insight into Deltaswap network status, stats, and messages would be great!

The service can even be extended to offer websockets or webhooks to stream new VAAs.

## Components

### Mongo

### Mongo Express
